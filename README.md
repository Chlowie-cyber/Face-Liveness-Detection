# Face Liveness Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Face Liveness Detection system** that can distinguish between real faces and spoofed/fake faces (e.g., printed photos or videos). It is designed to enhance **security in facial authentication systems** by preventing spoofing attacks.  

The project is implemented in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook**, with deep learning and computer vision techniques. The dataset used consists of **images collected personally by the developer**.

## Features
- Detects real vs fake faces from images or video frames.
- Preprocessing of facial images using OpenCV.
- CNN-based deep learning model for binary classification.
- Easy-to-run Jupyter Notebook for training and testing.
